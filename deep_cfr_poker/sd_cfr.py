"""Single Deep CFR policies, model archives, and exact Leduc evaluation.

SD-CFR removes Deep CFR's separately fitted average-policy network.  Instead,
it retains each player's advantage network after every CFR update.  A playable
agent samples one historical network per player at the start of a trajectory,
with probability proportional to the CFR averaging weight, and uses that
network for the complete trajectory.

For small perfect-recall games such as Leduc, this module can also reconstruct
the equivalent behavioural average exactly.  At information set ``I`` the
iteration strategy is weighted by both its CFR iteration weight and its own
reach probability.  This distinction is essential: a pointwise mean of action
probabilities is not, in general, the CFR average strategy.
